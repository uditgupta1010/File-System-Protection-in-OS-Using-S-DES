# File-System-Protection-in-OS-Using-S-DES

Abstract


Storage systems are increasingly subject to attacks. Cryptographic document frameworks alleviate the threat of uncovering information by utilizing encryption and integrity security strategies and ensure end-to-end security for their customers. 

This paper describes a generic design for cryptographic file systems and its realization in a distributed storage-area network (SAN) file system. Key administration is incorporated with the meta-information administration of the SAN file system. 

The two systems have been executed in the customer record framework driver. Benchmarks illustrate that the overhead is recognizable for some falsely developed utilize cases, however that it is little for normal document framework applications.
